                    <p class="about-p mt-20 text-justify">At an early age, my mother taught me that there are children in the world who are underprivileged, so learn the art of giving. She introduced me to the world of giving back and made me feel the happiness of giving. This thought of my mother helped me to lay the foundation of our "Sudhi Foundation," where we know that every child should get equal opportunities to build their future, and every child is fortunate. Money is never a parameter for getting a good education. We have one world and one life, so we need to make it worth living, which can only be done when giving will be a joy for everyone.</p>

I, myself came from a small village where education is not enlightened so much. So, when I was breaking the hard stones for being educated, I was certain to make a real difference for the people who really needed it. I felt an obligation of sharing my knowledge to those who after all this struggles, yet are falling behind. Not for myself; my motive of education was to do something for those children who lost their hopes.</p>

                            I love physics. Right from beginning, when I started understanding and observing the natural phenomena like formation of cloud, volcanic eruption, twinkling of stars, red sun in morning and bright at daytime, happening of day and night, changing the season etc. surprised me. These all phenomena are related to nature and we develop mathematics to understand and predict the phenomena. Therefore, we can say understanding the Nature in mathematical way is all about physics. So, this is very interesting subject. If you find it boring then you need to change your teacher. My attitude is all about make you understanding of physics in very lucid way. I am working as teacher and mentor since last five years. My motto is to spread the knowledge till last student who find difficulties to understand anything. “Knowledge is power” and after acquiring it one can contribute to his/her country and it may lead to make India great again. Education is only the key for overall development of society. so, “acquire it, use it and spread it”.
